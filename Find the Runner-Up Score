    RunnerUp.discard(max(RunnerUp)) #Remove the highest value.
    
    #list comprehension to remove all occurences of the max arr variable.
    arr_filter = [i for i in RunnerUp if i != RunnerUp]
    
    #Print maximum of arr_filter variable - second max of arr.
    secondLargest = max(arr_filter)
    print (secondLargest)
